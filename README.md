This is my repository for my JavaScript assessment - Find your hat.

## Assessment reflection questions

**1. What did you like about this project?**
  
  It's a fun and interesting project that gave me the space to decide what I want the program to do, on top of the basic functionalities that it should have.

**2. What did you struggle with in this project?**

I struggled with the generation of the maze. At first, my maze generated doesn't reflect the fieldCharacter so I wasn't sure if the maze was generated properly.

**3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?**

Perhaps, to include clearer instructions on the basic functionalities.
